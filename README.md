# Production-Line-Monitoring-DAQ-and-Data-Visualization
Production Line Monitoring DAQ created with an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 using AWS IoT Core, AWS Redshift, and PowerBI for visualization.

Prototype phase.
Real-time monitoring system for any production line.

Data Pipeline: Arduino > AWS IoT Core > AWS Redshift > PowerBI (Direct connector)

Alternative Data Pipeline: Arduino > Arduino IoT Cloud > PowerBI (Web, API connector)

Ideal Data Pipeline: Zigbee > AWS > PowerBI

# Future Work
## Monitoring Platform Development.

## Production data post-processing to show interaction with Supply Chain databases; reflect accounting and finance impact.
